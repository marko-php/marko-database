/**
 * Tracks transaction nesting depth and the after-commit/after-rollback
 * callbacks registered at each level.
 *
 * Drivers own the SQL (BEGIN, SAVEPOINT, RELEASE, ROLLBACK TO) and call
 * this class after each statement succeeds, so depth and callbacks stay
 * consistent across PostgreSQL and MySQL.
 *
 * - Committing an inner level hands its callbacks to the parent level.
 * - Committing the outermost level runs the after-commit callbacks.
 * - Rolling back a level discards its after-commit callbacks and runs its
 *   after-rollback callbacks.
 *
 * Callbacks run after the level has been removed, so a callback that opens
 * a new transaction starts from a clean state. An exception thrown by a
 * callback propagates and the remaining callbacks for that level do not run.
