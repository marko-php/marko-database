/**
 * Decides whether a destructive database command (db:rebuild, db:reset, db:rollback, db:seed)
 * may run in the current environment.
 *
 * Destructive commands need evidence that the database is disposable, not merely the absence
 * of the word "production":
 *
 * - development and testing: allowed
 * - production (or no environment set): refused, even with --force
 * - anything else (staging, qa, a typo, ...): refused unless --force is passed; with --force,
 *   the command still asks for confirmation when someone can answer
 *
 * A command whose change production also needs (such as pruning stale admin permissions) opts in
 * per call with allowInProduction: production is then treated like staging, so it still needs
 * --force and still asks when someone can answer. confirmInDevelopment makes development and
 * testing ask for confirmation too when someone can answer.
 *
 * --force is the terminal confirmation only. A command that calls this guard must also be marked
 * #[Command(destructive: true)]: callers that run commands for someone else (the MCP run_console_command
 * tool) read that marker, not the presence of a force flag, and a repository test fails when a
 * shipped command that depends on this guard is unmarked.
